<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Why make baked spaghetti instead of regular ol' spaghetti with meat sauce? It's all about that melty layer of cheese on top! If you prefer, slice some fresh mozzarella to finish it off instead.</p>
<p>Looking for a delicious side to pair with your spaghetti bake? Try our smashed broccoli, it's one of our faves.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°. Grease a medium baking dish with cooking spray. Cook spaghetti according to package directions until al dente, drain, and set aside.</li>
