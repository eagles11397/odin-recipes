<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Salisbury Steak is basically a homemade hamburger patty, mixed with some bread crumbs, egg, and Worcestershire sauce that is browned, then smothered onions, mushrooms, and brown gravy!</p>
<p>It’s a family favorite in our house, and I love that not only is it simple & easy to make – it’s also budget friendly!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h4>Steak Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 lb lean ground beef (I use 90%)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup Italian style breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>1 egg beaten</li>
    <li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
    <li>Optional: 1 onion, diced - I prefer to saute the onion with mushrooms later, to top the steaks with instead of mixing in the meat mixture but it can be done either way or both ways!</li>
</ul>
<h4>Gravy Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 packet brown gravy sauce</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>8 oz mushrooms, sliced</li>
    <li>2 onions, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<h4>For the steaks</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the beef, breadcrumbs, egg, Worcestershire sauce, and salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Shape the mixture into 4 equal sized hamburger shaped patties.</li>
    <li>Heat up Olive Oil in a skillet over Medium Heat.</li>
    <li>Once hot, add beef patties to heat, lying flat in a single layer.</li>
    <li>Cook 5-6 minutes on each side, until heated through (patties should be a minimum of 160 degrees.</li>
</ol>
<h4>For the gravy</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Follow package directions. I use McCormick Brown Gravy, purchased in bulk. The instructions say, Stir water gradually into Gravy Mix with whisk in small saucepan. Stirring frequently, cook on medium heat until gravy comes to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 1 minute. (Gravy will thicken upon standing.) Serve over Salisbury Steak.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Mushrooms and onions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Melt the butter in the skillet.</li>
    <li>Add the onion and mushroom slices.</li>
    <li>Saute until onion slices are translucent and soft.</li>
</ol>
<p>Plate one Salisbury Steak patty per person, top with onions & mushrooms, then gravy. Serve and enjoy!</p>
